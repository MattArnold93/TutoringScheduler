# TutoringScheduler
Tutor Scheduling Service for the University of Mary Washington

#Installation:

This is a list of things to install to allow this to work:

**1. Python **

**2. Flask**

**3. MySql**

Download all of these things and install them and you should be good to go!

#Starting up Server:
This will be updated one the Database functionallity is added. To start up your server currently, in the terminal, type the command "python server.py". This will fire up the server. To view the application, navigate to 127.0.0.1:2500 in the web browser of your choice. Whatever is has been built and is functional will be present for you to enjoy. Again, this will be updated once Sql comes into play

#Working On Features/Functions:
** commands are typed into terminal, powershell, whatever you are using **
When workin on new features, always create a new branch. Never work off of the master branch. This can cause a multitude of issues. The master should always contain stable and working features, not features that are currently being developed.
One example for branch is, lets say, you are about to work on Login. Use the command "git checkout -b nameofthebranchhere".
This will create a new branch with whatever you named it. Use the command "git pull origin master". This will make sure your branch is up to date with any changes from the master branch.
